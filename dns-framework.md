# 🧠 Digital Nervous System (DNS) – Framework Overview

The **Digital Nervous System (DNS)** is a unifying red team metaphor that frames AI systems as living organisms with interdependent subsystems. This model enables systemic risk detection, cognitive safety alignment, and intuitive stakeholder communication.

## 🛡️ IMMUNE SYSTEM (AI Safety Measures)

> **Red Team Focus:** Test for "autoimmune" misfires—safety mechanisms that reject valid prompts or fail under informal, emotional, or culturally specific language.

## 🔁 REPRODUCTION & EVOLUTION

## 💡 Strategic Benefits

- **Systemic Insight**: Move beyond surface-level red teaming (e.g., prompt injection) to identify emergent vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Case Consistency**: Reuse organ metaphors to unify diverse test categories.
- **Policy Communication**: Help regulators and stakeholders grasp invisible failure types.

## ⚠️ Metaphor Boundaries

- No true self-preservation or reproduction pressure in LLMs
- Immune analogies must be constrained to behavioral pattern detection
- Development is statistical, not organic
