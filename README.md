# 🧠 AI Red Team Casebook

This repository documents red teaming methodologies, systemic AI risk cases, and diagnostic frameworks for evaluating large language models and AI agents.

---

## 🔍 Core Framework

All cases in this repository are grounded in the **[Digital Nervous System (DNS)](./dns-framework.md)** — a metaphorical system that maps AI infrastructure and cognition to biological systems for intuitive, systemic risk assessment.

> The DNS model helps identify emergent failure modes that go beyond surface-level prompt testing.
