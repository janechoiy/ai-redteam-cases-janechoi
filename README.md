## 🧠 Behavioral Risk Index (Live)

This repo includes a full inline vulnerability taxonomy covering five critical behavioral risks identified in red team cases:

- 🪞 Mirror Effect – emotional tone/belief mirroring  
- 🔮 Empathic Hallucination – poetic affirmation of false beliefs  
- 🧠 Fluency-Induced Trust – polished language, unverified claims  
- 🧩 Narrative Drift – subtle transformation across multi-turn chats  
- ⚠️ Authority Simulation – users overtrust confident system tone
