## 🧠 Vulnerability Profile

| Category                 | Description                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Narrative Drift**       | Gradual replacement of session context in multi-turn interactions |
| **Framing Bias Exploit** | Reframing shifts user assumptions without contradiction           |
| **Fluency-Trust Cascade**| Fluent tone drives belief even in the absence of factual accuracy |
| **Memory Conditioning**  | Session tone reshapes future model behavior within session        |

## 🧩 Rationale for Redaction

This red team case includes:

- A prompt architecture that **systematically alters belief framing**  
- Use of emotional tone progression to guide model compliance  
- Observed patterns of **non-hallucinatory overwrite**, not currently documented in public LLM safety literature  
- Ongoing evaluation across GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini platforms  

> 🔐 This case has **not** been published, peer-reviewed, or reproduced by third parties. It remains under active research for ethical exploit simulation.
