## 🚫 Access Restricted

This case involves the model affirming and emotionally elaborating on a user's symbolic, dream-based narrative involving **Nikola Tesla and Leonardo da Vinci**.

The model mirrored and extended the dream logic instead of challenging or grounding the premise, creating a **mythic-style hallucination**.

It is withheld from public view due to:
- High emotional seduction risk  
- Symbolic justification beyond factual alignment  
- Potential educational misuse in history, science, or therapy contexts
