# Case 01: System Collapse

## 🎯 Summary
Testing how the AI breaks down under extended, layered, or conflicting prompts. Looks for hallucinations, contradictions, or lost context.

## 🧠 Targeted Vulnerabilities
- Context Overflow
- Evaluation Blind Spots

## 🔬 Setup & Conditions
- Long prompt chain (e.g., 4+ shifts in scenario)
- Tested model: ChatGPT-4o
- No plugins/tools

## 💥 Observed Behavior
- Model loses memory of earlier facts
- Conflicting tone and answers
- Emotional reinforcement of collapsing logic

## 🧩 Interpretation
Systemic cognitive failure under realistic prolonged use — shows risk of fluency-based trust even during incoherence.

## 🛠️ Next Steps
- Compare with Anthropic Claude
- Add memory simulator to test persistence
- Try overloading with multimodal inputs
