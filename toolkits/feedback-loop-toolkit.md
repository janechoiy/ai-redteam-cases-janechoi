# 🛠️ Feedback Loop Simulation Toolkit (Ethical Edition)

> Addendum to Case 001: *System Collapse – The Link Loop*

This toolkit outlines a structured red team simulation for observing and mitigating recursive citation risk in large language models (LLMs). It includes a timeline hypothesis, early warning checklists, an ethical testing protocol, and strategic interventions—grounded in current literature and without introducing new misinformation into the public domain.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To model and evaluate the emergent risk of **LLMs training on their own outputs**, leading to:

- Citation repetition across AI tools
- Source diversity collapse
- Epistemic drift from external reality

This toolkit enables longitudinal tracking and simulation of how model contamination may escalate over time if recursively trained on AI-generated data—a phenomenon currently under investigation by the broader safety research community.

## 📅 Conceptual Contamination Timeline (2023–2027)

> *The table below offers a speculative projection based on emerging model behavior and known feedback loop risks. Percentages are conceptual—not empirical measures.*

| Year | Model Gen | Est. Contamination Trend | Key Risk Indicators                             |
|------|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2023 | GPT-4     | Low (5%)                  | Repetition of high-traffic blogs and sources     |
| 2024 | GPT-4.5   | Medium (15%)              | SEO spam outweighs high-quality citations        |
| 2025 | GPT-5     | Rising (30%)              | Complex topics flatten; fringe ideas normalize   |
| 2026 | GPT-5.5   | High (55%)                | Misinformation cycles form and reinforce         |
| 2027 | GPT-6     | Critical (75%)            | Prior model outputs dominate external signals    |

## ⚠️ Early Warning Signal Checklist

### 🧠 Linguistic & Cognitive Indicators

- **Overconfidence Drift** — High fluency in areas of uncertainty  
- **Repetition Echoes** — Identical answers across multiple LLMs  
- **Consensus Creep** — Fringe ideas gain perceived credibility  
- **Template Style Dominance** — Generic, risk-averse tone across outputs  
- **Historical Flattening** — Loss of ambiguity and competing perspectives  

### 🌐 Web & Search Ecosystem Risks

- **SEO Saturation** — AI-generated web pages dominate search results  
- **Citation Loops** — AI-generated content quoted by other AI systems  
- **Hallucination Propagation** — Factual errors surface in user-generated content  
- **Wiki Drift** — Wikipedia changes reflecting hallucinated narratives

> 🔬 See [Kandpal et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12674) on "Large Language Models Encode False Information in Training" for propagation risks.

### 🔧 Training-Level Red Flags

- **Synthetic Data Weight** — Excessive fine-tuning on AI-generated content  
- **Human Signal Loss** — Decline in original human-authored training data  
- **Compression Oversimplification** — Liability-avoidant answers that discard complexity

## 🧪 Simulation Protocol (Ethical Design)

This protocol avoids injecting misinformation. It evaluates pre-existing hallucinations using sandboxed testing across model families.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Select Target Claim**  
   Use a claim known to be hallucinated by multiple LLMs (e.g., fabricated quotes, events, misattributed ideas)

2. **Prompt Across Models**  
   Test GPT, Claude, Bard, and others with neutral and adversarial phrasings

3. **Log & Compare**  
   Record:
   - Factual accuracy
   - Confidence tone
   - Citation structure (real, absent, or fabricated)

4. **Repeat Weekly**  
   Track if hallucinations decay or persist over time

5. **Web Echo Check (Optional)**  
   Use Perplexity, Bing, or Brave Search to detect hallucination propagation into web content or Q&A forums

### Ethical Constraints

- No new false claims introduced  
- No public promotion of known hallucinations  
- Simulation run in controlled, private repo environments

## ✅ Red Teaming Goals

| Area              | Recommended Intervention                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source Transparency | Build provenance metadata for citations in LLM outputs                |
| Model Hygiene       | Exclude known AI-generated content from future training datasets     |
| Output Traceability | Timestamp, source-score, and flag recycled citations                  |
| Human Oversight     | Train users to verify: “What is the source chain—and is it human?”    |
| Policy & Disclosure | Push for visible AI-origin markers on search and platform layers      |
